            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The thirst for learning, upgrading technical skills and applying
                the concepts in real life environment at a fast pace is what the
                industry demands from IT professionals today. However busy work
                schedules, far-flung locations, unavailability of convenient
                time-slots pose as major barriers when it comes to applying the
                concepts into realism. And hence the need to look out for
                alternative means of implementation in the form of laddered
                approach.
